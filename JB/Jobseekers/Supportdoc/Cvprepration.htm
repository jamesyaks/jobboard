        Submitting a CV/resume
    </p>
    <p>
        General information
    </p>
    <p>
        To make it easier for recruiters to determine where you might best fit within their
        organization, you can take a few simple steps to help them understand your qualifications.
        Preferably submit your resume in PDF or Microsoft Word formats. Text formats are
        also acceptable. All resumes and related materials (transcripts, portfolios, etc.)
        should be submitted in English. Only include essential personal information and
        be sure to include your name and how to contact you in the resume, not just your
        cover letter. Also, include your email, phone, and city and state of residence.
        Do NOT include your gender, date of birth, age, family status, military status,
        citizenship status or personal identification numbers. If you use acronyms, spell
        them out once unless they are well known in industry.

    <p>
        Educational background
    </p>
    <p>
        Your CV/resume should accurately reflect your academic achievements and accomplishments.
        Your resume should include the full name of all post-secondary institutions attended,
        degrees conferred, and a cumulative grade point average (if available) for each
        degree received. Only report your college/university-level education. However, if
        you completed a &quot;year abroad&quot; program as part of your pre-university education,
        feel free to include this in your resume. Provide a brief description of projects
        you completed related to the position for which you are applying.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your work experience
    </p>
    <p>
        You may be fresh out of college/university or have substantial work experience and
        a history of accomplishments. Either way, recruiters want to know what skills you&#39;ve
        acquired along the way. Recruiters look closely at the work experience section of
        your resume, so the information you provide here is very important. Provide your
        job title, employer name and dates of employment. Provide a brief description of
        the companies you have worked for especially if they are not well known. Provide
        your specific “key accomplishments” in each role. Recruiters want to see concise
        (ie. bulleted), important details on your key accomplishments and the impact your
        efforts had on your company. For engineering resumes, please include the programming
        languages and tools used for each. If you worked while attending a college/university,
        either during the summer or concurrent with your course work, be sure to mention
        this even if it isn&#39;t specifically related to a potential job. Customize your
        resume by highlighting the skills that are relevant to the position. Additional
        information Tell us what makes you unique! Recruiters value talent and intelligence,
        group spirit and diversity, creativity and idealism.

    <p>
        Be sure to include any awards received, articles published, conference presentations
        given, or professional organizations you are involved in (ie. SWE, IEEE, ACM, etc.).
        Recruiters don&#39;t need to see copies of awards or publications, just a reference
        to them.
    </p>

        You can also include personal projects related to the position.</p>

        Best of Luck!!!</p>
